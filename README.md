# odin-recipes
Here's a simple recipe site that I completed as an assignment on The Odin Project.

I was able to get more familiar with creating my boilerplates from scratch.  
Some HTML that I made use of:
<ul>
<li>Headings</li>
<li>Paragraphs</li>
<li>Ordered Lists</li>
<li>Unordered Lists</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Links</li>
</ul>
